## Vision Module

### Vision Constants

The `VisionConstants` module contains constants related to vision processing.

### ColorModel Class

A class for defining a color model for color detection.

### VisionController Class

A class for controlling vision-related processes and determining the direction of a specific color in a frame.

## Communicator Module

### I2CController Class

A class for controlling I2C communication.

### SerialController Class

A class for controlling serial communication and printing received data to the console.

## VisionCommon Module

### Viewer Class

A class for viewing and capturing frames.

## Main Script

The main script includes functions for processing instructions, handling directions, and capturing frames for vision processing. It utilizes various modules, including the `Vision` and `Communicator` modules, to achieve the desired functionality.

The script includes the following main functions:

-   `processInstruction`: Processes an instruction and handles communication with the I2C controller.
-   `handleDirection`: Handles the direction and processes the appropriate instructions.
-   `main`: The main coroutine that continuously captures frames and searches for cats.
-   `runSerialController`: Runs the serial controller in a separate thread.

The script also utilizes various external libraries, including `asyncio`, `logging`, `threading`, and `cv2` (OpenCV).

## Usage

The script can be used to process frames for detecting specific colors and controlling hardware components based on the detected colors. It can be modified and extended for various vision-based applications, such as object detection, color tracking, and more.

Ensure that the hardware configurations and communication protocols are set up correctly for the script to function as expected.
